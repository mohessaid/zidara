# The Zidara story

Newest first. Each entry: what happened, the problem, what we did, the numbers, the lesson.

## 2026-10-14 — The first gate held

**What happened.** M0 went green: workspace, `Score`, and every gauntlet step wired.
**Numbers.** 9 tests, passing natively and on wasm32 in Node; Android and iOS type-checks
pass; 8/8 branches covered; 27 mutants, 23 caught, 4 unviable, 0 missed.
**Lesson.** Wire every gate while the code is one file. Adding a gate to a finished kernel
means arguing with code that was never shaped to pass it.

## 2026-10-14 — Commands, not events

**What happened.** While planning, the kernel became a pure core: `decide(actor, command,
history) → events` and `fold(events) → state`.
**The problem.** The first sketch had a storage trait in the kernel. The server's database is
async and the browser's IndexedDB is async; a sync trait fits neither. And syncing *events*
from a phone means trusting the phone: a modified client could send evidence it never earned.
**What we did.** Stores moved to the shells. Offline, the phone queues *commands*; back online,
the server replays them through the same `decide`, with the same permission checks.
**Lesson.** A client that can only ask cannot forge. And "the phone and the server agree"
became a test we can run, not a hope.

## 2026-10-14 — Why not raylib?

**What happened.** The owner asked why the game map would use PixiJS and not raylib.
**What we did.** Checked rather than answered from habit. Raylib is small and fast, but it
draws glyphs one by one, without shaping or right-to-left ordering, so Arabic letters would not
join; a canvas is invisible to screen readers; and its web build needs the Emscripten target, a
second wasm toolchain beside wasm-bindgen.
**Lesson.** The deciding reasons were the audience's (Arabic, accessibility), not the
engine's speed. Raylib stays a candidate for a native shell later.

## 2026-10-14 — Economy class, with quality

**What happened.** The first spec rejected game engines on download size and framed the
target as low-end phones.
**The problem.** The owner corrected it: most devices in use today are capable. Target the
economy class with quality; if low-end users need something, build an experience for them.
**What we did.** The spec now has a device profile (a 2022 mid-range Android, 4 GB RAM, WebGL2)
and quality gates (60 fps, Lighthouse ≥ 90). Low end is a named future "Lite" experience.
**Lesson.** That correction cost an afternoon, not a rewrite, because experiences sit on a
fixed kernel contract. The separation paid for itself before any code existed.

## 2026-10-14 — The toolchain enforced the kernel rule

**What happened.** A throwaway probe built a tiny kernel for four targets on day one.
**The problem.** `uuid` with the `v7` feature failed to build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`:
making an id needs a clock and randomness, which plain wasm32 does not have. Then `proptest`
failed too: it pulls `getrandom`, which needs the `wasm_js` backend in a browser or Node.
**What we did.** The kernel uses `uuid` as a type only; shells generate ids through an `IdGen`
trait. Test-only `getrandom` gets `wasm_js`.
**Numbers.** After the fix, the same 2 probe tests passed natively and on wasm32 in Node; the
Android and iOS type-checks passed.
**Lesson.** Build for the hardest target on day one. It found an architecture leak for free.

## 2026-10-14 — Day zero

**What happened.** The repo was created around the design written on 10–11 October. Scope
for MIT Solve (deadline 2 November 2026, 12:00 pm EST): the prototype the challenge requires,
plus one governed AI agent. Setting: primary maths, equivalent fractions, ages 9–11, Arabic
first with French and English, and gamification that is the framework itself (the map is the
Progression block, stars are Judgement).
**Numbers.** 19 days to the deadline. 13 project skills installed.
**Lesson.** Solve asks for "convincing evidence it functions as claimed". The test gauntlet is
that evidence, so it is built first, not last.
